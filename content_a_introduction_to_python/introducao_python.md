# Studying the Python Programming Language

## Introduction

Let's look at the basic structures of the Python programming language. It is pertinent to know that such language has a lot of use today and it is one of the simplest to use. In addition, thanks to user collaboration, we have numerous ready-to-use libraries that enable us to perform complex programming tasks.

Let's start our study in Python with a definition that summarizes the ideals of that language:

> **"Python is a high-level, interpreted, scripting, imperative, object-oriented, functional, dynamic and strong typing programming language. It was launched by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Currently it has a community development model, open and managed by the nonprofit Python Software Foundation." (Wikipedia)**

### Dissecting the Definition

Above, a small excerpt from Wikipedia has been copied that talks about the Python programming language. In it, we can learn several characteristics of the language itself, such as:

- **High Level Programming Language**: Python is a language whose writing is very close to the human language using English as its main language, since it is its native language. In this way, we can communicate with the machine through a strong and intuitive interpreter.

- **Interpreted Language**: the source code in that language is executed by a computer program called an interpreter, which is then executed by the operating system or processor. This method differs from the languages ​​that are compiled for the machine language, such as the C programming language and its derivatives.

- **Script Language**: it is basically the act of developing an algorithm to automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be performed one at a time by a human operator.

- **Imperative Language**: It deals with the act of using actions to give orders, that is, through commands we can give orders to perform certain actions by the program. In this way, repetition loops, conditional structures, value assignment to variables and state control emerge to better implement this idea of ​​imperativity.

- **Object Oriented Language**: It deals with the idea of ​​having a programming language focused on the concept of "objects", using attributes (data in the form of a field) and methods (execution procedures).

- **Functional Language**: It deals with the idea of ​​having a language with function evaluation to perform certain actions. Specifically, Python has numerous libraries full of functions to be imported and used, emphasizing numerous fields of study in which programming applies.

- **Dynamic Typing Language**: being a positive feature for Python, this type of typing allows the use of variables that do not require data type declarations, as they are able to choose which type to use dynamically for each variable, being able to change it during compilation or program execution.

- **Strong language**: Python is a multiplatform programming language and is currently present in several operating systems, whether embedded or not. We have Microsoft using it on Xbox consoles, likewise Sony on Playstation consoles, the company Apple uses it on its IOS or macOS operating systems, it is present in numerous SmartTvs, present in operations to perform home automation, industrial automation and several others applications.

- **In addition**: the semicolon feature for command stops has been replaced by the indentation used in building the code, together with the colon (:) using to delimit subcommands of larger operations.
